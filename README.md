# CoSure - The Open-Source Policy Administration System

Welcome to the core repository for the CoSure project. This platform is being built to provide a modern, flexible, and developer-friendly Policy Administration System (PAS) for insurance brokers, MGAs, and InsurTechs.

## About The Project

CoSure is designed from the ground up to challenge the status quo of proprietary insurance software. Our goal is to eliminate vendor lock-in and high costs by offering a powerful open-source alternative that you can host and control yourself.

The platform is founded on a **Microservices, API-First, Cloud-Native, and Headless (MACH)** architecture, ensuring that it is scalable, resilient, and easy to integrate with.

### Core Vision

Our central thesis is that the ability to rapidly create and modify insurance products should be in the hands of business users, not just developers. We are achieving this by architecting the system around three decoupled, configurable engines:
* **A Dynamic Form Engine** 
* **A Pluggable Underwriting Engine** 
* **A Decoupled Rating Engine** 

This approach enables true "no-code/low-code" product configuration, making it possible to launch new products in weeks, not months.

## Getting Started

This project is currently in the early stages of development as outlined in our phased roadmap. We are focused on building the core quoting and binding kernel for our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

We are building in the open. Follow our progress here and feel free to get involved.

## Contributing

We are excited to build a vibrant community of contributors. Contribution guidelines will be published here as the foundational codebase is established.
